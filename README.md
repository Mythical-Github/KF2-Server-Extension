`cd <ANY_FOLDER_YOU_WANT>`  
3. Clone this repository and go to the source folder:  
`git clone https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-Server-Extension && cd KF2-Server-Extension`
4. Download ServerExt dependencies:  
`git submodule init && git submodule update`

### Bug reports
If you find a bug, go to the [issue page](https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-Server-Extension/issues) and check if there is a description of your bug. If not, create a new issue.  
Describe what the bug looks like and how we can reproduce it.  
Attach screenshots if you think it might help.

If it's a crash issue, be sure to include the `Launch.log` file. You can find them here:  
`C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Logs\`  
Please note that these files are overwritten every time you start the game/server. Therefore, you must take these files immediately after the game crashes in order not to lose information.

### Localization
The mutator supports localization and you can help translate it into other languages.  
It does not require any special knowledge or programming skills, so you just need to know the language into which you will translate.  
Here's a quick guide on how to do it: [localization guide](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2085786712/2942494909176752884)
