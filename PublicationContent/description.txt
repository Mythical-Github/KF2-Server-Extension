[h1]Usage (single player)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe to this mutator;
[*]Start KF2;
[*]Open console (`) and input:
[code]open KF-BioticsLab?Mutator=ServerExtMut.ServerExtMut[/code]
(You can add some options or replace KF-BioticsLab with the map you want)
[/olist]

[h1]Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If you don't understand what is written here, read the article [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url] before following these instructions.[/i]
[olist]
[*]Open your [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b];
[*]Find the [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and make sure that there is a line (add if not):
[b]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/b]
❗️ If there are several [b]DownloadManagers=[/b] then the line above should be the first ❗️

[h1]Mutator setup[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2085786712/4241773359646835902/][u]Look here[/u][/url]

[h1]Is it possible to make the game harder?[/h1]
It will be more efficient to use ServerExt together with other mutators (which add new zeds or game modes).
You can use [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2085786712/4241773359647296750/]my experience[/url][/u] or come up with something of your own.

[h1]If not working or you have no text[/h1]
Older versions of Server-Ext have the same file names - this can cause conflicts if you subscribe to them. Therefore:
1. Check your subscriptions. If you are subscribed to old versions of the mutator, cancel them.
2. Clear the cache (the game doesn't clear it). It's here:
[code]
Client:
C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Cache\

Server:
<KF2_DIR>/Binaries/Win64/steamapps/workshop/content/232090/
<KF2_DIR>/KFGame/Cache/
[/code]
If it’s not a problem for you to download all subscriptions again, you can simply clear this folder(s). Your subscriptions are downloaded the next time you start the game/server.
If you do not want to download the subscriptions again, delete only those folders that contain the files:
[code]
ServerExt.u
ServerExtMut.u
[/code]
3. Delete all ServerExt localization files. It's here:
[code]
Client:
C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Localization\
[/code]
Check all folders and delete all ServerExt.* files you find.
4. Re-subscribe to this mod and try again.
